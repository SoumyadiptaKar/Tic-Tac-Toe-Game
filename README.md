# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This game(Tic Tac Toe) is developed using HTML and Javascript.

Tic-tac-toe or noughts and crosses or Xs and Os - is a paper-and-pencil game for two players. The players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal/vrtical/diagonal row is the winner.

There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.
